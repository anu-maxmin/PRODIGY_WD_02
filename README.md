## Task 
To build a stopwatch web application, you can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is used to structure the elements of the application. By implementing functions fore staring, pausing, and resetting
the stopwatch, as well as tracking and displaying lap times, users can accurately measure and record time intervals. With these technologies and fuctionalities, you can create an interactive and 
user-friendly stopwatch web application. 

**Overview:**
The Stopwatch project is a simple and practical implementation of a digital stopwatch. It serves as a tool for measuring elapsed time with start, stop, and reset functionalities.

**Features:**
1. **Start:** Initiates the stopwatch, marking the beginning of time measurement.
2. **Stop:** Pauses the stopwatch, halting time measurement until resumed.
3. **Reset:** Clears the elapsed time and resets the stopwatch to zero.

**Approach:**
- Create one container in which all the elements are present.
- Inside this container add 2 divs that contain all time elements like an hour, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds, and another div contains 3 buttons for start, stop, and reset the stopwatch.
- Now add Styles to center the div container.
- Next, add a JavaScript file in which we will add onclick functions on all three buttons and create another function in which write all the logical code and add value to corresponding hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds, etc.

**Functionality:**
- **Time Measurement:** The stopwatch captures the elapsed time from the start to the stop action.
- **Precision:** Depending on the programming platform and language, the stopwatch can achieve a high level of precision in measuring time intervals.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Programming Language:** HTML, CSS , Javascript
- **User Interface:**  HTML/CSS/JavaScript for a web-based stopwatch

**Use Cases:**
- Useful for tracking elapsed time in various activities, including sports, workouts, or cooking.
- Provides a practical application for understanding timing functions in programming.

**Closing:**
The Stopwatch project is a valuable exercise in implementing time-related functionality and user interaction. It's a stepping stone for learners to explore more complex applications involving timers and event handling.
